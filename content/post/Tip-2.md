Another interesting tip I want to share is to copy formula down or to the right by using your keyboard.

Suppose you have a formula in Cell **A1** and want to drag the formula down to **A10**. Instead of using your mouse to do it, alternatively, you can also do the following:

Select **A1** -> **Ctrl** + **Shift** + **Down Arrow** until you reach **A10**, or you can just simply select range **A1:A10**. Then press **Ctrl** + **D** from your keyboard.

Similarly if you want to copy the formula to the right, simply using **Ctrl** + **R**.

Easy Peasy!

Have fun!
